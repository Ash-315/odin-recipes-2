        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Macaroni and cheese — also called mac and cheese in the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom — is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or meat.</p>

        <p>Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix.[3] The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package macaroni</li>
            <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 pound shredded Colby cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Place macaroni in a 2 quart casserole dish. Stir in cheese soup and milk until well combined. Sprinkle with shredded Colby.</li>
            <li>Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is brown and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
